# UnEmployed

Local-first Electron monorepo (pnpm + turbo) with two modules: `Job Finder` and `Interview Helper`. Doc map: `docs/README.md`. Read relevant `docs/adr/` decisions before changing behavior they govern; code shows current behavior, not permission to discard a deliberate decision.

## Rules

- Never commit, push, or create/update a PR unless the user explicitly asks. When the user asks for a commit, push it to the remote in the same step: a commit that stays local is not done. If the current branch was already merged, put the work on a new branch off `origin/main` and push that.
- Do not run `pnpm verify`, `pnpm test:evidence`, fingerprints, seals, custody, persona waves, or any release-acceptance chain unless the user explicitly declares a release candidate (ADR 0014). Run the smallest check that proves the change; the picker is in `docs/TESTING.md`.
- Never kill a process you did not start. No `pkill -f electron`, `pkill -f UnEmployed`, or `killall Electron`; those match the user's own `pnpm desktop:dev` instance. Stop only the instance you launched, through its own handle or PID tree, and report survivors instead of sweeping.
- Final submission, account creation, credentials, CAPTCHA, MFA, and legal consent stay user-owned. Automated and test runs stay `prepare_only` with `submitAuthorized: false` (ADR 0012).
- Keep durable knowledge in `docs/` and `docs/adr/`. Do not add status logs, handoff notes, evidence logs, or plan files to the repo; git history and the scratchpad cover that. Write an ADR when a decision would surprise a future reader.
- Do not edit docs unless the user asks or a doc contradicts the change you just made.
- Preserve the user's dirty worktree: never reset, clean, revert, stash, or delete their changes. Do not restore files another session deleted; ask the user instead.
- Never put personal resumes, credentials, or authenticated browser state in fixtures, prompts, docs, or evidence.

## Boundaries

- Renderer talks to Electron main only through the typed preload bridge. Never expose raw Node or Electron primitives to the renderer.
- Shared types, schemas, DTOs, and IPC payloads come from `packages/contracts`. No `any`, no untyped IPC, no deep cross-package imports.
- Discovery, source-debug, and apply preparation stay source-generic: no per-board route builders, query maps, triage overrides, or policy branches in shared orchestration (ADR 0007). Reusable provider adapters are fine; board-specific workflow policy is not. `pnpm source-generic:check` enforces this.
- `packages/browser-agent` owns browser workflow policy, prompts, and structured outputs; `packages/browser-runtime` stays generic. Renderer and Electron layers must not depend on browser-agent internals.
- `packages/agent-runtime` is product-neutral: no domain schemas, writes target reversible drafts, it never executes external actions, and persisted typed state is the memory rather than the model conversation.
- Persistence stays behind repository interfaces in `packages/db`; no SQL or storage details reach the renderer.
- Native code lives behind `packages/os-integration`, and only when Electron APIs are insufficient.
- Package ownership and data flow: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Testing the app

The user usually has `pnpm desktop:dev` running. For "use it like a user" checks: build once with `pnpm --filter @unemployed/desktop build`, launch an isolated instance with a temporary user-data directory and synthetic profile data, drive it, keep screenshots, batch the fixes, then rebuild once. Details and safety rules: `docs/TESTING.md`.
