/**
 * The one count treatment.
 *
 * Five shapes carried the same number before this - a transparent
 * right-aligned figure in the expanded sidebar, a filled pill in the compact
 * nav, a corner dot on the collapsed rail, a primary-filled pill on the More
 * trigger, and a mono bordered pill in Applications - so the same count
 * changed shape one breakpoint apart. `inline` is the plain right-aligned
 * tabular figure with no fill; `rail-marker` is the collapsed-rail marker,
 * the only variant that paints, because an icon-only rail has no room for a
 * figure beside a label.
 *
 * It never renders at zero. Three zero rules used to coexist and the one that
 * rendered a permanent grey "0" was the one that meant "nothing is happening".
 * The caller decides whether a count exists at all; this primitive will not
 * silently paint a zero pill on its behalf.
