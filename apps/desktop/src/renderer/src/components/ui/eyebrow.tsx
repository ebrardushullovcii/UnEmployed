/**
 * The small uppercase label that sits above a heading.
 *
 * 48 sites hand-rolled this span across seven recipes - three weights, three
 * tracking tokens and four foreground tokens - and an eighth using the field
 * label pair. This is the one recipe.
 *
 * It is deliberately a `span`, never a heading element and never
 * `role="heading"`. An eyebrow labels the block it introduces; promoting it to
 * a heading inserts a second entry into the document outline for the same
 * section and lets a card's real title read as its subtitle.
