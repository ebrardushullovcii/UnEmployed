/**
 * The shared selectable list row.
 *
 * Selecting a row used to change the row's own size: the selected row became a
 * bordered, padded, raised card while its unselected neighbours stayed flat,
 * and the badge line ("NEEDS APPROVAL") plus the status line ("Tailored draft
 * ready for your review") were rendered *only* when selected. Moving the
 * selection from row 1 to row 2 therefore moved every row below it by tens of
 * pixels, in all three lists that share the pattern (Find jobs results,
 * Shortlisted, Applications).
 *
 * The contract this primitive enforces:
 *
 *  - identical box metrics in both states - same padding, same margin, same
 *    border-width - so selection can never reflow the list;
 *  - selection is a background tint plus an accent bar drawn *inside* the
 *    existing box with an inset box-shadow, which consumes no layout space;
 *  - `aria-current` carries the state for assistive technology;
 *  - content lines reserve their slot via `SelectableRowLine` and are never
 *    conditionally rendered.
 *
 * Adopters must not pass a `selected`-dependent padding, margin, border-width,
 * gap or size class. In development the row detects that and reports it.
