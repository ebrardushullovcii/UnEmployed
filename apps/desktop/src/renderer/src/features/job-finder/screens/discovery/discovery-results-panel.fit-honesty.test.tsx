 *
 * The presentation helper was already wired into every surface, but the rule
 * that decides whether a percentage was earned only ever ran against bare
 * fixtures. Against the shape the real scorer emits for a card-only listing —
 * an "adjacent" role verdict, one saved-preference location requirement that
 * stayed unknown, and unavailable evidence confidence — it silently reported
 * "verified" and a bare "54% fit" reached the row. These tests assert the
 * strings a user actually sees for that exact shape.
