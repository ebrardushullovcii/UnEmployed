 * One save-feedback pattern for every settings section.
 *
 * Before this, `No unsaved changes.` sat under exactly one section's button
 * and nothing under the others, so a user could not tell from a quiet section
 * whether their edit had committed. Every section now renders the same four
 * states from the same component:
 *
 * - saving  -> no line; the pending button is the state
 * - failed  -> the failure sentence, announced, with a Retry button
 * - dirty   -> "Not saved yet."
 * - saved   -> the section's own confirmation, announced
 * - clean   -> "No unsaved changes." (also the stated reason the save is off)
 *
 * The saved confirmation was previously computed by every section and then
 * dropped on the floor: a committed save flipped straight back to "No unsaved
 * changes.", which is exactly what an untouched section says, so nothing in
 * Settings ever told a user their change had landed. It is now the state that
 * shows until the next edit.
 *
 * The disabled save is described by that same line through `aria-describedby`,
 * so a greyed button always has a reason attached to it.
