 * Home's source-health line, collapsed.

 * `summary.sourceHealth.flatMap(source => source.warnings)`), so a large
 * source plan having a bad afternoon printed one raw internal sentence per
 * source under the badge — "Public provider API collection failed: …",
 * "Agent discovery stopped after 10 steps…", "Unable to open a usable
 * starting URL…" — verbatim. That is a debug log, not a status line.
 *
 * Home now prints one plain-language count line instead. The categories come
 * from the classified per-source `health` state the run already recorded,
 * never from reading the error prose: each source carries exactly one health
 * state, so the categories are disjoint by construction and sum to the total.
 * The detail stays one click away behind "Review source health".
