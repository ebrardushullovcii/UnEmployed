 * The resume approaches a person may choose, in the order guided setup offers

 * the complete set.
 *
 * Every title and description says what happens to the person's own words.
 * The previous names ("Light edit", "Balanced rewrite", "Strong rewrite")
 * graded an effort nobody could see: seven of nine testers listed "Balanced
 * rewrite" as a phrase they could not interpret, and the strongest option was
 * read as a promise of "small deliberate stretches" rather than as a choice
 * about their own text. The behaviour and the default are unchanged (ADR
 * 0018); only the words are.
 *
 * `value` is either a tailoring strength or the sentinel `original_resume`,
 * which is stored as the application default rather than as a strength.
