/**
 * The one list-row treatment shared by every Job Finder collection list.
 *
 * Find jobs, Shortlisted and Applications used to look like three different
 * products: Find jobs drew flat rows ruled by a divider inside one bordered
 * panel, Shortlisted drew every job as its own rounded bordered card with a
 * status badge floating above the title, and Applications drew a third
 * variant again. A user reading the two screens side by side asked why there
 * are "so many different types of lists like this".
 *
 * There is now exactly one answer, and these constants are it:
 *
 *  - rows are flat and flush inside the single bordered panel. The shared
 *    `SelectableRow` primitive ships a card box (rounded, fully bordered);
 *    `jobFinderListRowClassName` turns that off and leaves one bottom rule as
 *    the divider between rows, so no row carries a border or rounding of its
 *    own;
 *  - every row uses the same padding and the same three-slot type scale:
 *    title line, meta line, status line;
 *  - the status badge sits in ONE slot - trailing on the title line - in all
 *    three lists, never floating over the row above the title;
 *  - selection stays entirely the primitive's business: a background tint plus
 *    an inset accent bar. Nothing here varies with selection, which is the
 *    no-layout-shift invariant `SelectableRow` enforces at runtime and
 *    `discovery-results-panel.selection-metrics.test.tsx` pins.
 *
 * List-specific content still differs - the fit verdict on Find jobs, resume
 * readiness on Shortlisted, the next step on Applications - but it is rendered
 * into these same slots.

 * five badges (recommendation, Provisional, listing activity, application

 * and push the row into a horizontal scrollbar. The badges used to live in a
 * full-width wrapping row below the title, which is exactly why they could

 *
 * `min-w-0` lets the slot shrink, `max-w-[55%]` guarantees the title at least
