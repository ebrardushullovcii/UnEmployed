/**
 * What an application run that reads "paused for review" is actually doing.
 *
 * - `waiting_on_you`: a hand-off or a question on one of its jobs waits on
 *   the person (Needs you has it).
 * - `ready_for_final_review`: every job is filled in and waiting to be sent,
 *   or already sent.
 * - `stopped_by_safeguard`: a safety limit (a sample to review, a company
 *   cap, a failure-rate pause) held jobs back; it does not carry on by itself.
 * - `finished`: nothing is left. Every job was sent, could not be applied,
 *   was skipped, or was tried again in a newer attempt. Old runs keep their
 *   "paused" state and summary from before later fixes; they are finished.
 *
 * Activity and Safeguards both read this, so they never disagree about
 * whether a run is a safety pause.
