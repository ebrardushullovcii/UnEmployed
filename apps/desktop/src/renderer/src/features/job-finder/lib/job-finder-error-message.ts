/**
 * Turn a thrown value into the copy a person reads.
 *
 * This used to be a pure pass-through: it stripped Electron's `Error invoking
 * remote method '…':` wrapper and returned the rest of the thrown message
 * unchanged, so a UUID, a bullet id, an internal operation name or a model
 * vendor's error text could land in a toast (RC-02). It was also used at only
 * 3 of the ~40 error render sites, so most sites could show that literal
 * wrapper string.
 *
 * It now **classifies**: any failure whose text proves it was written for a
 * developer is replaced by one member of {@link FAILURE_SENTENCES} — a plain
 * sentence that says what happened and what the person can do. Internal text
 * can no longer reach a screen through this function.
 *
 * ## Staged, not finished
 *
 * The residual branch still returns the stripped message, because some
 * packages throw text that is genuinely good copy for the person ("Unlock the
 * 'Summary' section before applying this change.") and this function cannot
 * tell, from a string, which screen it is about to appear on. Deciding that
 * per site is the adoption work each zone package owns: replace the call with
 * {@link describeFailure}, which never passes anything through, and put the
 * raw text behind a `TECHNICAL_DETAILS_LABEL` disclosure.
 *
 * Until then the residual branch is quarantined: `user-copy.test.ts` forbids
 * `getJobFinderErrorMessage(` outside its `PENDING_ADOPTION` allowlist, and
 * that allowlist must be empty when the last zone package lands. **Do not add
 * a new call site.** New code uses {@link describeFailure}.
 *
 * For the raw text itself — feeding another classifier, or filling a
 * disclosure — use {@link getJobFinderErrorDetail}, which is named for being
 * technical detail rather than copy.
 *
 * @param fallbackMessage the sentence for this specific action, used when
 * there is no readable failure text at all. Write it as a full sentence
 * saying what did not happen.
