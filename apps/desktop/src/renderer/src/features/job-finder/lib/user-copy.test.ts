/**
 * The guard for the Job Finder copy layer (RC-02, RC-03).
 *
 * `status-copy.ts` and `describe-failure.ts` make the right thing exist. This
 * file makes the wrong thing fail: a source scan over `features/job-finder`
 * and `pages` that forbids the three shapes that put system text on a screen.
 *
 * Adoption at the ~40 error sites and ~70 enum sites belongs to the zone
 * packages, so every file that still violates a rule today is named in
 * {@link PENDING_ADOPTION}. **Each zone package deletes its own entries when
 * it converts its files, and the list must be empty when the last zone
 * package lands.** That emptiness — not the existence of the modules — is the
 * acceptance criterion for RC-02 and RC-03.
 *
 * The allowlist is honest in both directions: an unlisted violation fails, and
 * so does a listed file that no longer violates. A stale entry is a failure,
 * which is what forces the list to shrink rather than rot.
