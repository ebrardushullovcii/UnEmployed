/**
 * One error voice for Job Finder.
 *
 * Round-nine review (RC-02) found ~40 render sites printing a thrown
 * `Error.message` verbatim as the app's error copy. What reached people that
 * way included `Apply run '<uuid>' is already executing.`, `Unable to find
 * bullet '<id>'.`, "Both resume import extraction branches failed." on the
 * first screen a new user sees, the literal string `Error invoking remote
 * method 'job-finder:…'`, and — through the provider transport — a model
 * vendor's own error text, provider name and key hints.
 *
 * The rule this module exists to enforce: **the renderer never renders a
 * thrown message.** A failure is classified into one of a small, closed set of
 * plain sentences ({@link FAILURE_SENTENCES}); the raw text goes only into a
 * Technical details disclosure, if anywhere.
 *
 * The set is closed on purpose. A new failure family is a decision about what
 * to tell a person and what they can do about it — it is added here, once,
 * with its sentence, rather than invented at a call site by forwarding
 * whatever a package happened to throw.
