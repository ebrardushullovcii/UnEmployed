/**
 * PKG-05's adoption guard.
 *
 * `docs/PRODUCT.md` adopts one placement rule for floating surfaces — flip
 * above, shift inside, height from the space actually available, internal
 * scroll with edge hints — and `lib/bounded-floating-surface.ts` is the one
 * implementation of it. Three surfaces did not route through it: `Saved views`
 * re-derived the whole clamp with a `Math.max(160, …)` floor that could exceed
 * the space left (so it painted past the window bottom), `Columns` was an
 * unportalled `absolute` popover trapped inside an `overflow-hidden` section
 * with no max-height at all, and the Studio Assistant resolved its no-cover
 * set once into cached nodes watched by a `ResizeObserver`, which reports
 * size and not position.
 *
 * These are source scans on purpose. The behaviours they pin are ones a
 * rendering test cannot see failing: a second clamp with a different floor is
 * correct at every height a jsdom test picks, and a cached node set is only
 * wrong once something moves.
