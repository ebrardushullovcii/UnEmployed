 * Decides what the resume workspace route should do for a just-synced
 * workspace snapshot.
 *
 * The workspace bootstrap intentionally leaves the deferred review queue (and
 * the other large collections) empty. A snapshot that is still hydrating must
 * never be treated as proof that the job is missing; the route shows its
 * loading gate instead. Once hydration is complete the snapshot's review queue
 * is authoritative, so an absent job is genuinely unavailable and the route can
 * show an explicit reason instead of silently bouncing.
 *
 * Benign background refreshes and fit-score recomputes land here too: as long
 * as the job stays in the hydrated queue, the route remains available.
