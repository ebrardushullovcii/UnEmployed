/**
 * One status vocabulary for Job Finder.
 *
 * Round-nine review (RC-03) found that the app had no status vocabulary at
 * all — only `formatStatusLabel`, a generic `_`-to-space title-caser called 53
 * times across 23 files, plus ~20 bare `replaceAll("_", " ")` sites. The
 * result was stored enum values printed as user copy: "Required human input",
 * "Site login required", "Awaiting Review", "awaiting user", "prepare only",
 * and — as the heading of every Assistant proposal card, directly above a
 * well-written plain-English summary — "replace section bullets".
 *
 * Every table here is an exhaustive `Record<Enum, string>` written with
 * `satisfies`, so adding a variant to the contract enum fails typecheck at
 * this file rather than silently reaching a user as a title-cased identifier.
 * A `Partial<Record<…>>` with a `?? formatStatusLabel(value)` fallback is the
 * shape this module replaces: it type-checks forever while leaking every new
 * variant straight to the screen.
 *
 * Voice rules these tables follow:
 *
 * - say what it means for the person, not what the system recorded;
 * - no stored identifier, no snake_case, no internal noun (envelope, run,
 *   revision, digest, snapshot, IPC, renderer);
 * - a state that needs the user says so, and says what they can do;
 * - nothing here implies Job Finder submits an application. It opens the
 *   employer's form and fills what it can; the person reviews and sends it.
 *
 * `applications-filters.ts` and `job-finder-browser-handoff-copy.ts` are the
 * two modules this one generalises — the same pattern, applied to the enums
 * that reach a screen.
 *
 * Deliberately not covered here, because their render sites belong to zone
 * packages that own the surrounding copy and will add their table beside their
 * screen: manual action request state and kind (Needs you), the CRM stage and
 * timeline-entry kinds (Applications tracker), authority envelope status
 * (Settings), outcome-analytics keys (Outcomes), source-intelligence method
 * and availability enums (Discovery), and safeguard dismissal kinds
 * (Safeguards).
