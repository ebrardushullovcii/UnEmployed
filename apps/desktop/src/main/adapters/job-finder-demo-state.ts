/**
 * Prepare-only apply lineage for the demo queue.
 *
 * The loader used to reset the workspace with zero rows in every apply table,
 * so Applications could only ever render its empty state and the browser
 * hand-off — the one place that names "the Job Finder browser" and offers
 * "Check whether this step is done" — was unreachable without actually running
 * a preparation against a live employer page. These rows are plainly synthetic
 * (`demo_` identifiers, example.com-shaped LinkedIn demo URLs) and describe two
 * *paused* outcomes only: one where the user must finish a conflicting field in
 * the open application, and one where the site blocked automatic preparation.
 *
 * Nothing here ever claims a submission: every result stays `awaiting_review`,
 * every attempt stays `paused` with a null outcome, `submittedJobs` is 0, and
 * both privacy receipts keep `finalSubmitAuthorized`, `finalSubmitOccurred`,
 * and `accountCreationAuthorized` false with no external writes.
