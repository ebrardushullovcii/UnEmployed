/**
 * Records, at startup, that a search which was still running when the app
 * closed was interrupted.
 *
 * A run left in `running` has nothing driving it: no process will finish it
 * and no screen can tell it apart from a search in flight. That is what let
 * the app claim "50 new jobs saved" for a search it had dropped and then say
 * "Nothing was deleted" over the fifteen that survived. Recovery moves the
 * stranded run into history with an `interrupted` phase and a warning naming
 * what it kept, so every surface reads the run's own frozen report instead of
 * recomputing a number from whatever is left.
 *
 * Idempotent: a run already carrying a terminal phase is returned untouched,
 * so re-running this on the next start changes nothing.
