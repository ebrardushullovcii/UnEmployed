/**
 * One job, seen on several sources (ADR 0030).
 *
 * Every source that listed a job keeps its own sighting in the job's
 * provenance: the listing page it linked to, the application link it carried,
 * and, once that page has been read, the apply link the page itself shows.
 * The saved job is built from exactly one sighting, never a mix of two:
 *
 * 1. The earliest-discovered sighting whose application route is the
 *    employer's own form wins.
 * 2. When no sighting is known to be one, the earliest-discovered sighting
 *    that is not an access gate wins.
 * 3. Equal discovery times go to the lower target id, so the result never
 *    depends on the order the sightings were merged in.
 *
 * "The employer's own form" is read from the route's shape, never from a site
 * name (ADR 0007): the sighting came from a public provider feed (the feed is
 * the applicant tracking system itself), or the apply link on its listing page
 * stays on the site the listing is on. A link that leaves that site is a
 * hand-off, and so is an in-board quick apply.
