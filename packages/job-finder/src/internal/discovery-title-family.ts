/**
 * Whether the listing's own title sits in the same occupational family as a
 * saved target role, read back from one assessment.
 *
 * The scorer already decides this — it is why one row earns "Role title
 * aligns closely with the current target roles." and another "Role title is
 * adjacent to the target list but not an exact fit." — but until now the only
 * way to read the verdict was to look for those sentences, and every caller
 * that did lumped all three misses together. So a role a person plainly asked
 * for ("Executive Assistant I" against a saved "Executive Assistant") was
 * demoted to "Also found — Weaker matches" for the sole reason that its
 * listing text was never captured and it could not earn a score.
 *
 * `titleFamilyMatch` on the assessment is the field of record. This resolver
 * prefers it and falls back to the sentences for every assessment written
 * before that field existed, so banding is correct for stored rows today and
 * keeps working once the scorer records the verdict directly.
 *
 * Source-generic: it reads only the scorer's own verdict, never a board.
