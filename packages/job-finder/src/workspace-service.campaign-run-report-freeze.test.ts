 * A finished run's counts are measured once, at its own terminal commit. The
 * plan card, Find jobs, Home and Search history all quote that one record.
 *
 * A later Run now that never starts — the sources are gone, a safeguard
 * blocks it, or a read fails before the pipeline opens a run — still reached
 * the campaign's terminal commit. With no new run to commit, that commit
 * landed on the previous finished run and recounted it against the current
 * workspace, where the jobs it had introduced were by then already members of
 * the plan. The same search silently changed from "66 new" to "51 new" with
 * no search in between.
