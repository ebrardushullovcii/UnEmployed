/**
 * What the apply agent can do.
 *
 * This is a harness, not a form-filler on rails. The agent gets the ordinary
 * powers a person has in a browser — look, read, click anything, follow a
 * link, type, go back, wait, scroll — and is trusted to work out how a
 * particular site wants to be used. Job Finder does not decide in advance
 * which button is the Apply button, because every time it has tried, it has
 * been wrong about some site a person could have used without thinking.
 *
 * The deliberate exceptions are safety, and they are small: the answer to a
 * question comes from the person's own facts rather than the model's
 * imagination, and sending an application goes through a separate check.
