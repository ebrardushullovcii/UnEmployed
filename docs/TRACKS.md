# Tracks

Use this file as the short execution queue. Detailed state belongs in `docs/STATUS.md`; completed chronology belongs in `docs/HISTORY.md`.

## Status Keys

- **Active**: implementation or an internal acceptance gate is still running.
- **Ready**: scoped work can start without another product decision.
- **Decision**: implementation waits for an explicit product choice.
- **External**: evidence requires user-controlled credentials, consent, hardware, or another host.
- **Authorization**: repository or external state must not change until the user explicitly approves it.
- **Completed**: current integrated implementation and acceptance are recorded elsewhere.

## Active

- None. Deep production acceptance and agent-tool refinement are complete.

## Ready Queue

- None. The approved Candidate Asset lifecycle and résumé visual/export refinement are integrated; current remaining work is verification and the explicitly authorized local commit.

## Decision Required

- None. Windows DACL hardening and generic PDF/DOCX/OCR extraction remain deferred product scope rather than release-blocking decisions.

## External

- User deployment review: with explicit consent, walk the current Job Finder using the user's private résumé, judge extraction and generated wording, and report concrete UX/quality defects with screenshots. Use `docs/audits/JOB_FINDER_DEEP_ACCEPTANCE_REVIEW.html` as the review guide.
- Resume an authenticated Workday application checkpoint only after voluntary browser sign-in and explicit user confirmation. Never infer authentication from navigation.
- Validate Interview Helper microphone/system audio, popup, screenshot, and capture-protection behavior on macOS/Linux target hosts.
- Run personal screen-reader/reduced-motion acceptance during deployment review.

## Explicit Authorization

- Commit, push, create/update a remote branch, or open a PR only after the user accepts the intended scope and explicitly authorizes that exact repository action.

## Completed Context

- Roadmap implementation: fit/cache truth, durable job identity/freshness, progressive discovery, action handoff/resumption, résumé grounding/coverage/versioning/cache/quality gates, per-job CV choice, application readiness/recovery/packet/receipt, workspace deltas, scale/persistence, saved-state feedback, Task center, diagnostic/performance evidence, Windows Interview health, and the current customer-facing Job Finder journey.
- Current Windows production evidence: fresh first-run setup, three-profile live public-provider ranking, original-CV and configured Luna-high tailored-CV journeys, Greenhouse original-CV safe checkpoint, Ashby tailored-CV safe checkpoint, anonymous Workday sign-in handoff, responsive Action Inbox, and limited Interview Helper popup regression.
- Deep production acceptance: 104 current screenshots across the deep matrix, résumé flow, and first-run flow; zero renderer/console errors; zero document/main horizontal overflow; final submission/account creation remained disabled and untouched.
- Candidate Asset lifecycle: opt-in 30/90-day retention starts after successful import, removal/expiry enters seven-day Trash, restore selects a fresh policy/clock, and startup/lazy enforcement performs ordinary filesystem purge without a secure-erase claim.
- Résumé presentation: all eight apply-safe families use distinct flat, print-aware typography and restrained accents; card/pill document chrome is removed while preview editing hooks and ATS-safe export semantics remain intact.
- Final integrated gate: guidance/docs/source-generic checks, package lint/typechecks, fit calibration, and 257/257 test files pass; 1,902 tests pass with one intentional skip. Optimized identity/ledger timings retain repeatable margin under unchanged 2,000 ms budgets.
- Full details and exact artifacts: `docs/STATUS.md`, `docs/TESTING.md`, `docs/audits/JOB_FINDER_DEEP_ACCEPTANCE_REVIEW.html`, and `docs/audits/JOB_FINDER_COMPLETION_REVIEW.html`.
- Older milestones: `docs/HISTORY.md`.
