# Documentation

Read only what the task needs. Code shows current behavior; ADRs record deliberate decisions. Investigate a mismatch before treating either the implementation or the decision as wrong.

Historical audit reports and evidence manifests live in `docs/audits/`. They are records of past runs that the release-evidence scripts fingerprint, not guidance; do not read them for current state.
