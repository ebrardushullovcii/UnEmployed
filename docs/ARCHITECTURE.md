# Architecture

## Workspaces

- `apps/desktop`: Electron main, preload, renderer
- `packages/contracts`: schemas, DTOs, typed IPC
- `packages/core`: small shared helpers and result types
- `packages/db`: persistence and repository boundaries
- `packages/knowledge-base`: ingestion, chunking, retrieval
- `packages/browser-runtime`: browser lifecycle and generic automation primitives
- `packages/browser-agent`: browser workflow policy, prompts, tool use, structured outputs
- `packages/job-finder`: discovery, source-debug, resume, apply orchestration
- `packages/interview-helper`: prep, live session, transcript, cues
- `packages/ai-providers`: provider interfaces and adapters for chat, vision, STT, and embeddings
- `packages/os-integration`: tray, hotkeys, windows, capture-policy adapters
- `packages/testing`: fixtures, fakes, harness helpers

## Boundary Rules

- renderer talks to Electron main through typed preload APIs only
- cross-package contracts live in `packages/contracts`
- package public APIs are the only supported import surface
- `browser-runtime` stays generic; site or workflow policy belongs higher
- `job-finder` discovery, source-debug, and apply preparation stay source-generic; do not add per-board route builders, query maps, triage overrides, or policy branches that only make sense for one job source
- source-specific code is acceptable only for reusable provider adapters or contained `browser-agent` extraction/navigation quirks
- reusable provider adapters currently include public Ashby board ingestion and exact-job Workday candidate-experience ingestion; they normalize provider payloads into shared discovery contracts without adding board-specific workflow policy
- `pnpm source-generic:check` guards the browser/discovery boundary
- interview conversation/session state belongs to `interview-helper`; Electron media permissions and optional overlay windows stay in desktop adapters, while reusable OS capture/hotkey policy belongs to `os-integration`
- native helpers are a last resort and must stay behind `packages/os-integration`

See [ADR 0007](adr/0007-source-generic-browser-workflows.md) for the source-generic browser decision.

## Main Flows

- desktop: renderer -> preload -> Electron main -> package services
- resume import: desktop ingress -> parser/text/vision branches -> review candidates -> accepted canonical writes
- discovery: ADR 0013 selects API-first ingestion, deterministic compact browser
  observation second, and bounded model escalation third. `browser-agent` owns
  source-generic Playwright observation/extraction policy and returns strict,
  bounded, snapshot-scoped contracts; `job-finder` owns budgets, canonicalization,
  matching, dedupe, ledger, persistence, and run truth. A model sees only failed
  or uncertain bounded observations and does not own the whole run. Existing
  agent checkpoints still carry retained-job progress while the replacement is
  integrated, and each checkpoint's new postings use the same canonical merge
  path as final collection.
- applications: current production remains prepare-only. ADR 0013 replaces the
  coupled form-driver direction with observe -> propose -> authorize -> execute
  -> verify. Browser packages own generic observation and execution hands;
  `job-finder` owns authority envelopes, preflight, idempotency, revocation,
  lineage, capacity, and tri-state outcome truth. Models and heuristics may
  propose typed actions but cannot grant authority or prove external outcomes.
- approved application answers: Profile owns mutable reusable answer content;
  Electron main is the only approval boundary. Main canonicalizes the current
  non-empty answer bank, computes its content digest, and appends an immutable
  snapshot through `packages/db`. Authority/preflight records bind only the
  snapshot revision and digest. Renderer readiness receives counts, kinds,
  status, and lifecycle identity but never raw answer text or a caller-supplied
  digest. An approved snapshot does not grant, arm, or execute anything.
- product actions: schema-validated local tools call a narrow injected subset of the `job-finder` workspace service. They never expose raw IPC, browser primitives, arbitrary navigation, or filesystem access; proposal-only Profile Copilot calls persist reviewable patch groups without applying them
- source-debug: `job-finder` orchestrates phases and artifacts, `browser-agent` returns structured attempts, `db` persists runs and evidence
- browser visual evidence: `browser-runtime` owns screenshot capture and cleanup; `browser-agent` owns generic trigger policy and interpretation; `job-finder` persists only schema-validated summaries
- interview live session: visible chat/audio UI -> typed preload -> Electron main-hosted `interview-helper` service -> typed AI/audio/screenshot adapters -> visible responses, source-labeled transcript, and post-session review
- generative AI: domain services -> a small product-specific agent harness -> `packages/ai-providers` -> OpenCode Go. DeepSeek V4 Flash handles normal text/tool work through Chat Completions with requested `max` reasoning; GPT-5.6 Luna handles image-only work through Responses with `high` reasoning. The harness gives the model narrow typed read/write/validate tools over a temporary task transaction, records every call, and separates direct work, correction, validation, fallback, and final product output. Domain code still owns canonical state and user-review rules. Local Codex bridges remain replaceable loopback development transports. Audio transcription stays a separate local Whisper or explicit audio-model role.

### Persistence safety

- Repository collection reads are lossless by default. Explicit `limit` and
  `offset` options are stable pages for display or traversal; paged results must
  never feed a destructive whole-collection replacement.
- Ordinary saved-job mutations use transactional row-local deltas/upserts. The
  update callback runs against the current rows inside the SQLite immediate
  transaction, so concurrent settings, discovery, and application work cannot
  replay a stale full snapshot over unrelated jobs.
- Resume-affecting job changes and approval invalidation are one atomic commit.
  A crash or concurrent write cannot leave a changed job paired with approval
  derived from its previous facts.
- Whole-collection replacement APIs are reserved for authoritative reset/import
  boundaries whose caller owns the complete collection. They are not product
  read-modify-write primitives.
- Singleton profile, search, setup, settings, and discovery writes update only
  their owned SQLite value. They never rebuild unrelated collections.
- Employer-application capacity uses an immutable SQLite-backed start mark on
  the exact apply result before browser/session work. In-flight reservations
  are serialized in memory within the desktop singleton process; persisted
  marks provide restart durability, while legacy uncertainty remains explicit
  rather than being converted into fabricated start facts.

### Campaign and CRM ownership

- `packages/contracts` owns campaign, dashboard, activity-control, CRM, custom-stage, reminder, interview, timeline, and export shapes, plus campaign-rule and funnel projections, schedule state/pause windows/run facts, campaign digests, in-app campaign notifications, and the job-finder intelligence state (outcome events and analytics, resume strategies and per-job selections, company entities and merge review, and safeguard records).
- `packages/db` persists campaign collections beside the existing workspace state. SQLite migration 10 backfills one default campaign for an existing workspace without rewriting its jobs or applications. CRM data remains an optional schema-defaulted part of each application record, so old records still load.
- `packages/job-finder` owns campaign selection, discovery/job membership, dashboard projection, preparation limits and stop rules, global activity gates, serialized CRM updates, no-response automation, duplicate hints, and export content, plus campaign-rule evaluation and truthful funnel projection, schedule/digest/notification derivation, outcome recording and analytics, collision-safe outcome identity resolution, resume-strategy recommendation and per-job selection, company reconciliation and merge review, and safeguard gate operations. Its automatic safeguard path derives idempotent technical discovery/source-debug evidence and leaves explicit user-owned blockers out of the technical sample; grouped-answer contradiction evidence is persisted as an advisory local fact.
- `packages/job-finder` also owns the derived `companyJobs` projection over the complete company-linked saved-job collection and the atomic exact-employer exclusion mutation. The projection is not limited to the active discovery list. A job belongs to a company only through its exact normalized canonical name or a user-approved merge alias; legacy aliases and domains are non-authoritative. Domains remain corroborating, conflicting, or research evidence and do not create ownership or domain-wide exclusion policy. Reconciliation does not destructively migrate SavedJob domains.
- Company salary/offer mutations cross a repository commit boundary that reads
  transaction-current intelligence, the exact SavedJob, and the exact optional
  ApplicationRecord under one write transaction. `packages/job-finder`
  validates current ownership and lineage there, uses monotonic timestamps, and
  commits all or nothing.
- Electron main owns typed IPC, local save dialogs, and the desktop campaign scheduler service (interval-driven due-run evaluation with power suspend/resume). Preload exposes only schema-checked campaign, activity, CRM, rule/funnel, schedule/digest/notification, outcome/strategy/company/safeguard actions. The renderer never writes the database or filesystem directly.
- Active-campaign list scoping is a renderer projection over authoritative campaign job IDs. Workspace-wide search deliberately keeps all local entities and changes the active campaign before navigating to an item from another campaign.
- Manual CRM stages do not change apply-run authority, browser outcomes,
  external-write evidence, or submission receipts. Final submission will be
  governed only by the separate typed authority envelope from ADR 0012; current
  prepare-only contracts remain in force until that replacement exists.
- Outcome recording resolves the campaign and application identity for the exact job. Omitted identities are accepted only when the job has one unambiguous campaign or application record; multiple matches require an explicit identifier and conflicting identifiers are rejected before the event is written. Outcome events remain user-controlled local facts and never create apply or submission evidence.

## Resume Safety

- tailored mode requires a current approved resume export before apply; original-CV mode requires the imported source file to remain available on disk
- browser apply runtimes receive one typed application-resume artifact whose source is either `tailored_export` or `original_upload`; orchestration must not fabricate a tailored export for an original file
- stale drafts cannot be used as approved exports
- every canonical experience remains represented in the editor even when excluded from recruiter-facing output
- named resume strategies resolve a base resume document plus headline, skills, coverage, tailoring-strength, and evidence-boundary policies into generation context. This context is advisory input to résumé generation; strategy selection never approves, readies, or unstales an artifact.
- current prepare-only browser execution must keep `submitAuthorized: false`,
  treat ambiguous/final controls as stop points, and never infer submit
  permission from an apply mode. Future submit authority requires the new typed
  path from ADR 0012; legacy flags do not acquire that meaning
- bounded intermediate ATS persistence is a separate prepare-only capability.
  Its production resolver requires one active, unexpired envelope bound to one
  job, one canonical origin, one verified resume digest, and the current
  main-approved answer snapshot. The browser receives only that exact origin
  and a main-owned callback which re-reads the same envelope revision before
  every short field-save window. Revocation, revision/answer/origin/resume drift,
  or callback failure closes the window; none of this grants a final action
- Browser Runtime keeps Playwright `Page` private and exposes optional typed
  application observation/exact-one-action hands only to main-process
  composition. Job Finder owns the authority/preflight/idempotency policy around
  those mechanics through the explicit
  `@unemployed/job-finder/application-submission-runtime-main` subpath. No
  renderer, preload, IPC, or legacy apply route calls that seam; browser-local
  action facts can record only `not_submitted` or `outcome_uncertain`, never
  prove `submitted`
- uncertain outcomes are a durable stop state. Applications may resolve one only
  from an explicit two-step user confirmation after the user checks the employer
  site. Renderer input carries no evidence id, timestamp, revision, URL, or
  retry decision; Electron main derives those facts from current persisted
  lineage and `packages/db` commits the original uncertainty, resolved outcome,
  idempotency, ApplyJobResult receipt/state, and exact ApplicationRecord
  projection atomically. This recovery channel records external operator
  evidence but grants no browser action or submission authority
- prepare-only browser execution installs page and network mutation guards before filling fields. A separate `intermediateMutationsAuthorized` capability may allow autosave/draft/non-final ATS traffic, but it never permits DOM form submission, `requestSubmit`, a final-control click, navigation mutation, beacon, WebSocket, EventSource, or WebTransport; omitted authorization remains false. The capability is deny-default and field-scoped: one exact grounded field action opens a same-origin 3-second/8-request window, only fetch/XHR `POST`/`PUT`/`PATCH` traffic with explicit draft/autosave/save/update/field/answer/upload/progress semantics can pass, and final-action, cross-origin, ambiguous, late, or exhausted traffic is blocked and journaled. Both the page wrapper and Playwright route enforce the boundary. Observed external writes and receipt attestations describe Job Finder's own authority and actions — they cannot confirm an external site outcome, which only the user can verify on the site
- prepare-only execution continuously rechecks application-origin service-worker registration through the run sentinel plus an in-page scan, with explicit rechecks before safe-advance clicks and at the preparation step limit, and pauses untouched before any further field or click action when a worker can influence the origin; a failed employer-page goto is classified once as the technical `application_page_unreachable` blocker carrying only causal-free user copy, while its raw transport detail stays in session diagnostics
- exact provider job URLs are prioritized before per-source collection caps so a configured vacancy cannot silently degrade into an unrelated board result
- authentication remains owned by the dedicated browser profile. The app may open a source and persist a human-action prompt, but it must not receive credentials or infer that authentication succeeded merely because the browser launched; the user explicitly confirms sign-in before a source-scoped retry
- staleness rules live in `packages/job-finder/src/internal/resume-workspace-staleness.ts`

## Interview Capture Protection

Interview Helper defaults to the ordinary visible main window. Advanced overlay windows and global/tray controls initialize only when `UNEMPLOYED_INTERVIEW_ADVANCED_SURFACES=1`. When enabled, overlay capture exclusion remains adapter-owned capability state: Electron `BrowserWindow.setContentProtection(true)` is a request, while real platform-specific verification and any future authorized stronger capture-exclusion path must stay behind `packages/os-integration`.

See [ADR 0003](adr/0003-interview-helper-live-session-architecture.md) and [ADR 0008](adr/0008-visible-first-interview-helper.md).

See [ADR 0010](adr/0010-opencode-go-mixed-text-and-vision-routing.md) for configured text/vision routing and [ADR 0009](adr/0009-luna-high-default-and-capability-contracts.md) for the contract-first AI boundary that remains in force.

## Known Debt

- keep watching for any `browser-runtime` dependency on `browser-agent`; runtime should stay lower-level than workflow policy
- the generic application-preparation state machine currently lives in
  `browser-runtime`; decompose it as ADR 0013's deterministic policy executor is
  integrated so workflow authority moves to `job-finder` and only reusable
  browser mechanics remain below
- compact discovery observation is integrated as the deterministic first pass
  in the production discovery run loop. Keep the bounded legacy/model path as
  fallback until compact coverage is broad enough to retire it with evidence
- remaining source-named discovery debt from the browser substrate evaluation must not expand to other sources
