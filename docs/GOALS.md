# Goals

Use this for durable product direction. Current state lives in the code and git history.

## End State

Build one local-first Electron desktop app for job search, resume preparation,
user-controlled application automation, and interview prep/live support.

## Job Finder North Star

Job Finder is the current product priority. Its purpose is to let a person move
from an accurate profile to a large, useful job pipeline and completed
applications under their chosen authority without needing to understand the
product's internal concepts.

The primary journey is:

1. Set up and verify the profile and original resume.
2. Find hundreds or thousands of relevant, current jobs across repeated searches.
3. Judge results quickly and shortlist the jobs worth pursuing.
4. Generate strong, job-specific resumes, including aggressive rewrites when
   selected, then edit, export, and approve the exact artifact.
5. Execute applications according to the user's selected automation mode,
   including final submission when autonomous authority is explicitly enabled.
6. Ask for help only when work falls outside that authority, then track outcomes.

Profile -> Find jobs -> Shortlisted -> resume policy and review -> Apply ->
Applications must feel like one continuous journey. The next useful action should
be obvious without reading long explanations or learning terms such as campaign,
strategy, lineage, or runtime. Needs you, Task center, search plans, resume
approaches, Companies, Outcomes, Documents, diagnostics, and Settings support
this journey; they must not compete with it.

Acceptance binds to these user outcomes, not the current implementation. The
discovery engine, browser control, profile-editing tools, resume editor, agent
loops, and supporting libraries should be replaced when a measured alternative
is materially simpler, more reliable, more truthful, or more effective.

Implementation constraint: users pick and enable sources; discovery,
source-debug, and apply preparation must improve generically through shared
browser policy, typed evidence, and learned target instructions—not per-board
route builders, triage overrides, or rescue branches in shared orchestration.
See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) and [ADR 0007](adr/0007-source-generic-browser-workflows.md).

### Product Outcomes

- A first-time user can import a resume, correct the resulting profile, configure
  at least one source, find jobs, shortlist one, create and approve a tailored
  resume, prepare the application, and reach Applications without hints.
- A returning user can maintain hundreds or thousands of retained jobs across
  search plans and repeated runs without losing decisions, selection, filters,
  approved artifacts, application records, or responsiveness. A representative
  5,000-job hydrated workspace must keep bounded result rendering and the
  canonical warm-route readiness budget at or below 500 ms; do not relax that
  budget or rerun the heavy scale gate during every small edit.
- Discovery prioritizes relevant, current, inspectable results rather than raw
  volume. It must support broad collection over repeated runs, preserve protected
  in-flight work, explain conservative mismatches, and recover truthfully from
  source or network failures. Inactive or stale is not the same as proven closed;
  visible Posted/Updated dates must agree with sorting; each job retains safe
  source provenance; and the UI distinguishes found, retained, target, and new
  results instead of disguising a conservative retention budget. Healthy repeated
  runs deduplicate prior results and add newly available relevant jobs; when the
  configured sources are exhausted, the product says so instead of relisting old
  jobs or implying that more were found.
- Fit is evidence-backed guidance, never an “ATS score” or interview probability.
  Required evidence, conflicts, and unknowns remain inspectable before the
  aggregate score or recommendation.
- High-volume work is efficient: bulk triage does not eject the user from Find
  jobs, bulk resume generation does not hijack selection, per-job failures do not
  discard successful work, and progress survives navigation. Completed and failed
  per-job outputs survive restart; an in-flight batch stops safely rather than
  pretending to resume work that no longer owns a running process. A user can
  prepare job-specific resumes for dozens of shortlisted jobs in a working session
  through bounded batches without repeating the same setup for every job.
- Tailored resumes are materially better for the exact vacancy while remaining
  truthful. Strong/aggressive generation may substantially rewrite, combine,
  reorder, and elaborate supported evidence, but it never invents employers,
  dates, credentials, seniority, historical titles, named technology, absent
  skills/keywords, leadership, ownership, education equivalence, transferred
  accomplishments, or numbers. Every draft remains editable, reviewable,
  versioned, and exportable. Use requires either approval of that exact artifact
  or an explicit autonomous authority envelope with a saved resume policy that
  authorizes it; the receipt must identify the exact artifact used. Deterministic
  evidence checks are authoritative; a model never certifies its own output.
  Show the exact AI change before approval/export, obtain granular consent before
  remote resume processing, and exclude salary expectations plus privacy-risk
  defaults such as photo, date of birth, marital status, government IDs, and
  salary history unless the user explicitly opts into a locale-specific need.
  Quality is judged against the original resume for the exact target job,
  including a blinded human preference and a practical "would I send this?"
  decision; synthetic validators alone cannot establish superiority.
- Guided chat must cover the complete supported editing surface, not a handful of
  demo phrases. Profile Copilot owns typed profile and preference proposals;
  resume Guided Edits owns draft revisions. Natural requests such as changing
  salary expectations, rewriting a summary, emphasizing a skill, reorganizing
  experience, or revising a draft must produce clear reviewable changes or ask a
  narrow clarification instead of silently guessing. Neither surface receives
  application submission or other external authority.
- Application authority is user-configured rather than permanently
  `prepare_only`. The product supports prepare-only, confirm-before-submit, and
  autonomous-submit modes. Broader modes require an explicit, inspectable,
  revocable authority envelope covering scope, volume, answers, resume policy,
  employer-site writes, final submission, stop conditions, and expiry. Existing
  workspaces remain prepare-only until the user chooses otherwise. CAPTCHA and
  anti-bot challenges are never bypassed; unavailable credentials or MFA,
  unknown eligibility facts, unseen material attestations, ambiguous controls,
  and actions outside the saved policy pause for the user instead of being
  guessed. Every external write and submit attempt keeps exact lineage and a
  truthful receipt; internal flags never prove a site outcome. See ADR 0012.
- Local persistence, backup, reset, and corruption recovery stay equally honest:
  a database-only backup never claims to restore documents or browser state,
  reset names its irreversible commit point, and corruption recovery validates a
  restore or quarantines/fails closed instead of silently starting fresh.
- Applications remains useful at high volume: completed, withdrawn, stale, and
  otherwise inactive records can be closed or archived without erasing their
  receipts, history, artifacts, or outcome truth, while active work stays easy to
  find.
- The durable throughput goal is thousands of relevant jobs discovered and
  hundreds of applications completed across many runs and days. The current
  10-per-run and 20-per-local-day limits remain migration defaults, not an
  immutable product ceiling. Any configurable replacement must be explicit,
  warning-backed, bounded by the user's authority envelope, and safe against
  duplicate or uncertain submission.

### Experience Bar

- Prefer simple, natural defaults and progressive disclosure over extra setup,
  dashboards, cards, filters, status badges, and explanatory copy.
- Remove obsolete, duplicate, or unused destinations and controls instead of
  keeping them visible for compatibility. Follow familiar desktop and mainstream
  product conventions unless this product's safety boundary requires a difference.
- Use one user-facing name per concept, one clear primary action per state, and
  consistent page headers, subnavigation, dividers, spacing, density, controls,
  dates, statuses, and empty states across the app.
- Inputs, cards, selected rows, disabled reasons, and status surfaces must remain
  visually distinct and equally scannable in both light and dark themes without
  relying on color alone.
- Keep useful information above the fold. Avoid oversized cards, duplicated
  summaries, empty panes that repeat each other, excessive padding, nested
  scroll confusion, and metadata that pushes the decision or editor below view.
  Densify the information needed for the current decision; progressively disclose
  secondary controls, diagnostics, and explanation rather than hiding key facts.
- Every empty, blocked, failed, stale, or interrupted state must explain the
  truth in plain language and offer the nearest safe recovery action.
- Navigation never silently discards profile, resume, settings, answer, or
  application edits. Unsaved-change protection names the affected work and offers
  clear Save, Discard, and Stay choices in product language; avoid a generic
  browser or operating-system prompt when an in-app decision can remain truthful.
- Navigation and layouts must remain stable at supported desktop sizes, compact
  widths, keyboard-only use, and native Electron 125% zoom. Controls must not
  jump, overlap, clip, become unreachable, or rely only on color. Native 200%
  zoom is deliberately excluded from current acceptance because it produces a
  mobile-like layout with little diagnostic value; historical evidence remains
  historical rather than silently restoring that requirement.
- WCAG 2.2 AA is the current ship baseline. AAA focus appearance and 400% reflow
  are follow-up aspirations, not gates that silently expand current acceptance.
- Nested panes own wheel scrolling while the pointer is over them and hand control
  back at their boundary; unmarked inner scrollers inside a marked pane own the
  wheel before their pane, and text controls keep browser-owned scrolling; the
  outer page must not hijack every wheel event.
- Settings and advanced features must have explicit ownership and save scope;
  users should not have to discover which of several similar Save buttons owns
  a field.
- Power-user speed must not make the default journey harder for a novice.
  Search, filters, density, keyboard navigation, saved views, and bulk actions
  should accelerate repeated work while preserving safe, understandable defaults.
  Discoverable keyboard shortcuts may accelerate frequent navigation and shell
  actions, but they supplement visible controls rather than becoming required.

### Product-First Verification

- Real use of a freshly built Electron app is the primary UX evidence. Automated
  tests are regression and integrity guardrails; they do not prove that a screen
  is clear, simple, or useful.
- Dogfood the complete journey with visible UI actions and realistic synthetic
  data. Inspect screenshots and actual behavior, not DOM snapshots or stale
  artifacts. Never claim a visual or workflow fix without replaying the affected
  state in the app.
- Cover first-use and returning-use paths, populated and empty states, source
  failures, interrupted work, original-CV and tailored-CV choices, bulk work,
  restart durability, and the safe employer handoff for the selected mode.
- A tester who cannot name the next useful action without internal vocabulary
  or outside hints has found a journey defect, even if the control works.
- Do not repeatedly run thousand-row suites, full lint, full typecheck, builds,
  or broad matrices while iterating. Prefer inspection, live use, and one narrow
  regression per confirmed defect; batch heavy validation once per fix wave and
  run one Electron session at a time.
- Release acceptance and blind persona waves run only after the user declares a
  release candidate (ADR 0014). Private-resume wording, live-source relevance,
  authenticated employer behavior, and personal accessibility always need
  user-controlled review.

## Product Shape

- `Job Finder`: profile, resume import, discovery, source-debug, resume workspace,
  applications, and apply flows governed by the user's selected authority mode.
- `Interview Helper`: target-context setup, rehearsal, transcript-aware live cues, protected overlays, retention, and post-session review.
- Shared platform: local profile, document memory, application history, browser runtime, AI provider roles, desktop shell, tray, hotkeys, and settings.

## Durable Priorities

- Local-first persistence is the source of truth.
- Workflows are UI-first with agent acceleration, not chat-only.
- Browser-driven job workflows are a first-class product surface.
- Typed contracts and package boundaries matter more than convenient imports.
- Shared data should be reused instead of rebuilt per workflow.
- External writes and submissions occur only inside an explicit, inspectable,
  revocable user authority envelope.
- Interview capture and overlays must stay explicit, visible, adapter-owned, and auditable.

## Delivery Shape

- Foundations and Job Finder baseline are landed.
- Interview Helper first integrated desktop workflow is landed.
- Quality, truth, and recovery outrank maximum speed: an honest blocker or a
  truthful failure report beats a fast unverifiable claim, and fixes land only
  after root-cause review.
- Release acceptance runs only after the user declares a release candidate
  (ADR 0014). User-controlled gates (private resume quality, configured
  provider/network transport, authenticated application sites,
  packaging/signing, and personal accessibility) remain separate deployment
  reviews and are never established by synthetic evidence.
- Future work should be concrete hardening, target-platform validation, source-generic discovery improvements, authorized capture-protection extensions, or specific regressions.
