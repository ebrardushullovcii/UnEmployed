# Architecture Decision Records

ADRs capture durable decisions and rejected alternatives. Use them to avoid reopening settled trade-offs.

## Policy

- Write an ADR only when a decision is hard to reverse, surprising without context, and based on a real trade-off.
- Keep ADRs short: context, decision, consequences, and rejected alternatives only when they matter.
- Do not mutate accepted ADRs to pretend history changed; add a new ADR when a decision is superseded.
- Update this index whenever ADR files change.
