# ADR 0017: Embedded Job Finder browser

Status: accepted

## Context

Job Finder previously opened a separate Chrome profile. Users need to see and take over the same pages that the agent operates, without switching windows. Authentication storage must survive closing the browser, while live pages and browser activity must stop.

## Decision

Electron main owns sandboxed `WebContentsView` tabs in the persistent `unemployed-browser` session. The renderer supplies typed commands and viewport geometry through preload; remote pages receive no preload or Node access. A Peek overlay, expanded view and minimized launcher present the same live tabs. The native view always paints above the app's document, so app chrome that must sit over the page (the toolbar menu, the import picker) hides the view behind a still of the active page captured through the bridge. The address bar follows browser rules: typed input that is a web address opens, anything else becomes a web search; agent and app navigation stays strict.

Playwright remains the automation client. A private loopback WebSocket bridge exposes only the owned page targets through their Electron debugger sessions; it does not expose the Electron application or an app-wide debugging port. Browser runtime accepts a generic host interface. Workflow policy and application authority remain in their existing packages (ADRs 0007, 0012 and 0013).

Minimizing preserves pages and automation. Agent input arrives over CDP and never moves the pointer, while a page the agent creates still takes native focus on its own; focus therefore counts as the user only on a page that is on screen, past its creation, with the pointer over it. That is the user stepping in: it pauses workspace activity, cancels operations and disconnects automation before their click lands. There is no separate "take control" button; a "Resume agent" control hands the page back. Existing in-page preparation guards can remain until navigation or reload; the toolbar explains this without reloading and discarding fields automatically. Closing additionally destroys all browser tabs, clears service workers and their caches, and closes network connections, while retaining cookies and site sign-in storage. When a run ends on its own, its pages are released as soon as the panel is hidden, so an idle agent holds no page. When a run stops because only the user can continue (sign-in, a human-verification challenge), the browser keeps that page, raises attention that the launcher animates, and releases it once the user closes the browser or the next run starts. Workspace cleanup cannot close a page during handover. Automation rejects an already running service worker and pauses if one starts during guarded work.

The browser presents as the Google Chrome its Chromium is built from: the user agent drops only Electron and app tokens, client-hint headers and the in-page brand list carry the Chrome brand, and a bridge-free page preload gives `window.chrome` its Chrome shape. Google's sign-in refuses the bare Chromium identity before any credentials are entered but accepts this one; nothing about automation or the device is hidden or faked. Reaching a sign-in page is not proof of authentication. Credentials, consent, CAPTCHA and MFA remain user-owned. The app does not bypass provider restrictions.

Users may bring sign-ins over from a browser profile already on the device, chosen from a list the app discovers (Chrome, Chromium, Brave, Edge, Arc, Firefox), the way browsers import from each other. Main copies the profile's cookie store, decrypts it where the platform allows (macOS through a Keychain prompt that is the user's consent; Linux with the default key; Windows Chromium stores are reported as unreadable), and writes only unexpired, unpartitioned cookies into the embedded session. Renderer receives profile names, counts and generic messages, never paths or cookie values. Passwords, bookmarks and history are not imported, and an imported sign-in is not promised to work. Renderer state, prompts and logs must never contain imported cookie values.

## Consequences

Electron and Playwright upgrades require focused native browser checks, including hidden-page rendering, popups, routing, handover and resource cleanup. The scoped bridge has a deliberately limited CDP surface and is not a general remote debugging service. Existing prepare-only guards remain required; embedding adds no submission authority.

The default live desktop host is embedded. `UNEMPLOYED_BROWSER_HOST=external` retains the dedicated Chrome path for compatibility. Existing deterministic desktop harnesses retain their prior host behavior unless they explicitly select the embedded host. Closing preserves the session partition, not a Chrome profile folder; some imported sessions still need a fresh sign-in.
