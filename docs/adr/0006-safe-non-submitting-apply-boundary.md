# Safe Non-Submitting Apply Boundary

Status: accepted

Job Finder apply automation may assist with preparation, form context, recovery, resume approval checks, and reviewable application records, but it must stop before final submission unless the user explicitly re-authorizes live submit work in a new decision. This preserves user consent, avoids accidental applications, and keeps apply automation auditable while still letting the product provide useful non-submitting assistance.

## Considered Options

- Enable live submit by default: rejected because accidental or unreviewed applications are too high risk for the current product boundary.
- Treat visual evidence as apply authority: rejected because screenshots are evidence for review/recovery, not permission to act or submit.

## Consequences

- Apply code must preserve consent interrupts and resume approval gates.
- During unauthorized preparation the browser guard blocks every mutating request, every form submission and every channel (WebSocket, EventSource, beacons). Page-owned reads are allowed by shape (a GET, HEAD or OPTIONS request, or a POST whose body is a GraphQL document made only of queries) and refused the moment they would carry a value that is currently in a form field, since that is the only way a read could send a prepared answer. That lets a page load its form definition, language files, module manifest or GraphQL data and render at all; images and media with a query string remain blocked because the page guard cannot see what they carry.
- On a page with no application form, the runtime follows an Apply _link_ or a manual-entry _link_ ("Apply manually", "Start application") by opening its URL: that is the navigation it would make for an application URL anyway, and nothing on such a page is prepared. A manual-entry _button_ may be clicked; an Apply _button_ on a listing is never clicked, because with a signed-in profile it can be a one-click apply. A page the runtime just opened gets the same render grace as the first step before it is judged.
- Visual checkpoints must not produce browser actions, final-submit guidance, generated answers, selectors, or site-specific workflow rules.
- Reopening live submit requires an explicit new authorization and updated contracts, product docs, tests, and review flows.
